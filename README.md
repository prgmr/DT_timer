# timer

This timer project uses a state manager from the GetX library.  
It displays the time in the format (minutes : seconds : milliseconds).  
It contains 4 buttons that perform the following actions:  
a) Start the time, and once started, it should change its state to become the button that pauses the
time  
b) Save the time and add it to the lap time list each time it is pressed while the timer is running,
and this list will be displayed below the timer  
c) Delete the entire list of saved laps  
d) Reset the time
